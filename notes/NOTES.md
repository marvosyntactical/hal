# hal9k bot notes

* snowboy deprecated; write own keyword detector?
* listen doesnt wait

* keyword spotting: have list of keywords associated with each state
* inherit wider scope keywords from above
* load worst/smallest model trained on all the keywords of the new state when transitioning 

* search: youtube api -> bash scripts
* -> play using cvlc
* search: 
* "search for something please"
* starts playing 1st bad result -> "next"
* starts playing 2nd bad result -> "next"
* starts playing good result -> "perfect"
* -> continues playing, waiting for keyword
